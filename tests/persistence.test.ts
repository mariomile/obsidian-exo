 * `view.ts` — the `const c: Convo = {…}` in `restore()` (disk → memory) and the
 * literal in `toConvoData()` (memory → disk). `view.ts` imports `obsidian` and
 * has zero unit tests, so nothing else in the tree can observe that the two
 * halves still agree.
 *
 * The failure they are exposed to is asymmetric and silent: add a field to one
 * literal and not the other and the build is green, the typecheck is green
 * (both sides are optional), and the field simply evaporates on the next
 * reload. That is exactly how a fan-out child would come back from a restart
 * with no parent, jump out from under it in the sidebar, and read as a chat
 * nobody started.
