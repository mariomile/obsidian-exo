 * keyboard while doing its own from the mouse. Stopping the key press before it
 * reaches the row is what makes the two agree.
 *
 * `stopPropagation`, never `preventDefault`: the default IS the button's click.
 * Only Enter and Space, so an ancestor's arrow-key navigation still works while
 * focus sits on the button.
