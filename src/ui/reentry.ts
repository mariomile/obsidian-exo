/**
 * The re-entry surfaces: the "since you left" line and the resume verbs.
 *
 * Both are painted here rather than in `view.ts` for the usual reason — that
 * file is at its size ceiling — but also because neither is transcript
 * behaviour: they are the frame around a transcript you are returning to.
 * Every decision about WHAT they say lives in `core/reentry.ts`; this file owns
 * the elements, where they are inserted, and what a click goes to.
 *
 * Two rules that are structural, not stylistic:
 *
 *  1. **No width gate.** The Recap Rail is main-area-and-wide only, because it
 *     is a second column and a 300px sidebar has no room for one. The re-entry
 *     line is a single row inside the column that already exists, and the user
 *     who most needs it is precisely the sidebar user — so nothing here reads
 *     a width.
 *  2. **The streaming invariant.** While a turn is streaming exactly one of
 *     {working row, open card, caret} is live. Neither surface paints then:
 *     the band returns early, and the verbs are empty by construction
 *     (`resumeVerbs`).

 * prompt, you collapse it, the agent works twelve steps, and when you come back
 * the active chat never changed. Nothing on that path revealed anything, and

 *
 * Two gates, both load-bearing:
 *  - `isShown()`: these are workspace-wide events, and a pane that is still
 *    collapsed has not been re-entered. Boot goes through here for the same
 *    reason: `convo-bridge` materialises the view with `loadIfDeferred()` for
 *    background work, so `restore()` can run against a sidebar nobody opened.
 *  - a band already on screen is left alone WHILE IT IS STILL CURRENT, so
 *    re-running this over a line the user is in the middle of reading does not
 *    silently delete it. Presence alone was the wrong test: nothing else ever
 *    removes the band, so a line that was read but never clicked stayed in the
 *    DOM forever and made every later re-entry a no-op, so the next twelve steps
