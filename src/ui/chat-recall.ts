/**
 * Semantic recall over conversations — the impure half. Spawns
 * `scripts/chat-recall.mjs`, which owns the index and the embedder; this file
 * owns only process lifecycle and the contract with the caller.
 *
 * Why a subprocess and not an in-plugin embedder: the model and its runtime are
 * ~100MB of WASM that the plugin has no business bundling, and running them on
 * the renderer thread would freeze the UI for the duration of a query. Out of
 * process, a slow query costs latency and nothing else.
 *
 * Availability is a normal state, not an error. When the local embedder is not
 * installed the script exits 3, `unavailable` latches, and the sidebar simply
 * never shows a Related section again this session.
