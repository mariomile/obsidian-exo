/**
 * Last session capability snapshot (skills/commands/agents/tools/mcpServers),
 * own file — NOT settings. It used to be mixed into data.json's
 * `cachedSessionCaps` (69% of the file's bytes, ~46KB of 66KB measured
 * 2026-08-06) even though it is pure cache: rebuilt from a live SDK session
 * every init, never authored, and every default-value migration in
 * settings.ts had to reason about a blob unrelated to any actual setting (the
 * exact shape of the recurring "flip a default, data.json doesn't migrate,
 * check live data" gotcha).
 *
 * Persisted anyway (not held only in memory) because it has real UX value: it
 * seeds the $/@// menus and the Capabilities panel immediately after an
 * Obsidian restart, before the first session's init arrives. Slightly stale
 * is fine here — it's menu seeding, not authorization — so this mirrors
 * dream-snapshot.json's contract exactly: simple write, no backup rotation,
 * corrupt/missing collapses to null instead of failing.
 *
 * Adapter is a narrow subset of Obsidian's `DataAdapter`, not the type
 * itself — same convention as `WorkflowSignalStoreAdapter` — so this stays
 * decoupled from the exact Obsidian version's surface.
