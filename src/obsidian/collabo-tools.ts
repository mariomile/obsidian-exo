 *  fresh key every time and the service's own dedup — the guarantee the
 *  design doc promises ("a network retry cannot duplicate a comment or
 *  suggestion") — never fired. Hashing the fields that make the operation
 *  what it is means an identical retry produces the identical key, and a
 *  genuinely different comment or suggestion (even on the same document)
 *  produces a different one.
 *
 *  Fields go through `JSON.stringify` as an array, not a plain-space join:
 *  a join has no field-boundary marker, so `text="Fix typo", quote="in the
 *  intro"` and `text="Fix typo in the", quote="intro"` joined to the
 *  identical string and hashed to the identical key, silently dropping the
 *  second, genuinely different comment. `JSON.stringify` escapes each
 *  field's own quotes, so no value can forge a fake field boundary. */
