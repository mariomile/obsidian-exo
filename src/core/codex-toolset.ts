/**
 * Codex session toolset: the pure half of the Codex ↔ Obsidian bridge's
 * sandbox honesty (no Obsidian imports).
 *
 * Bridge tool handlers run in the Obsidian process and BYPASS codex's own
 * sandbox, so a read-only sandbox must get read tools only. `ask_user` is the
 * deliberate exception: it mutates nothing (blocking the turn on a question
 * card is user interaction, not a write), and a read-only session that cannot
 * ask a clarifying question would be needlessly dumber than its Claude twin.
 *
 * When the sandbox is not read-only, the input array is returned AS-IS (same
 * reference): the tool list sent to sessions stays byte-identical to a build
 * where this function is not in the path.
