/**
 * Vault Setup — pure logic (no Obsidian imports).
 *
 * Exo reads and writes a fixed set of paths under its memory root for its
 * memory features (open loops, task board, preferences, cockpit staleness,
 * dream pass). On a fresh vault none of that exists, so every one of those
 * features silently degrades to empty/inert with no signal to the user that
 * anything is missing. `scaffoldItems(paths)` is the create-only-if-absent
 * list that fixes that; `isVaultSetUp` is the single-file detection check used
 * to decide whether to offer the scaffold at all.
 *
 * All paths derive from the caller-supplied `ExoPaths` (core/paths.ts), so the
 * root is configurable and the module stays pure/testable.
 *
 * The "full" preset also lays down the marioverse knowledge-OS: guided
 * templates for vault-context/preferences/mental-model, README-documented
 * rules/decisions/learnings folders, and hand-fillable `agent/{persona,human,
 * now}.md` identity blocks. The blocks carry a template marker so the "Agent Is
 * the Folder" seeder regenerates them while untouched (isUnfilledAgentBlock) yet
 * never clobbers hand-written identity — that's why pre-creating them is now
 * safe, where a blank stub would once have looked already-seeded.
 *
 * Still excluded: `review.md` (its mere existence is read as a UI signal that
 * there's something to review).
