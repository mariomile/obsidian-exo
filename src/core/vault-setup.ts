/**
 * Vault Setup — pure logic (no Obsidian imports).
 *
 * Exo reads and writes a fixed set of paths under its memory root for its
 * memory features (open loops, task board, preferences, cockpit staleness,
 * dream pass). On a fresh vault none of that exists, so every one of those
 * features silently degrades to empty/inert with no signal to the user that
 * anything is missing. `scaffoldItems(paths)` is the create-only-if-absent
 * list that fixes that; `isVaultSetUp` is the single-file detection check used
 * to decide whether to offer the scaffold at all.
 *
 * All paths derive from the caller-supplied `ExoPaths` (core/paths.ts), so the
 * root is configurable and the module stays pure/testable.
 *
 * Deliberately excluded (see the implementation plan's Global Constraints
 * for why): the `agent/{now,human,persona}.md` blocks (owned by the "Agent Is
 * the Folder" LLM seeder — pre-creating blanks would make it think they're
 * already seeded) and `review.md` (its mere existence is read as a UI signal
 * that there's something to review).
