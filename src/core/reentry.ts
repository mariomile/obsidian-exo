/**
 * Re-entry — the pure model behind "coming back to a chat is a designed
 * moment". Two things live here and nothing else: what a conversation did
 * WHILE YOU WERE NOT READING IT, and which verb should be on offer above an
 * empty composer given the state you are coming back to.
 *
 * The read position is the one new persisted fact in this phase, and it is
 * deliberately an INDEX, not a timestamp: the band has to be rendered AT a
 * position in the transcript, and a transcript is a list of messages, not a
 * clock. `readIndex` counts messages the user has already seen, so it is also
 * the DOM index of the first unread turn — one number that answers both "what
 * is new" and "where does the line go".
 *
 * "Seen" is the whole contract, and it has two halves: a reveal reads
 * everything on screen (`planReveal`), and a turn that FINISHES in front of
 * you is read as it lands (`ui/reentry`'s `noteTurnEnd`). Without the second
 * half the number only ever moves when you switch tabs, and the line ends up
 * reporting twelve steps you sat and watched.
 *
 * Everything here is Obsidian-free and DOM-free, same discipline as
 * `chat-rows.ts`: this decides what the line SAYS and whether it may appear,
 * `ui/reentry.ts` owns the elements and the click targets.

 * The slots of the "since you left" line, in the ONE order they are ever
 * painted in. Fixed by position is the whole design: the line is read at a
 * glance on re-entry, and a line whose second number means "files" on Monday
 * and something else on Tuesday has to be read word by word instead.
 *
 * There is no "questions waiting" slot, and there deliberately cannot be one.
 * An `ask` or `plan` card reaches `messages` only when its TURN ends, and that
 * teardown cancels whatever card was still open. So every unanswered card in a
 * transcript is a cancelled one, and the slot could only ever point at a dead
 * surface. While a card is genuinely open the conversation is streaming and the
 * band refuses to paint at all (the streaming invariant); a pending permission
 * is not a segment in the first place. A slot that can only count what the user
 * cannot answer is a slot that lies.
