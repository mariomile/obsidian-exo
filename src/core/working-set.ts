 * can take a tab away — a partial list here is worse than none, because the next
 * reader will trust it:
 * - `pinned` — the user said so explicitly. Also excluded from the cap's count.
 * - `id === activeId` — the tab being looked at right now.
 * - `streaming` — a turn is in flight.
 * - `needsInput` — the turn is blocked on a permission or ask prompt.
 * - `hasDraft` — unsent composer text or images.
 * - `hasQueue` — messages waiting behind the current turn.
 *
 * Each one is work the user has not finished. When every over-cap tab is exempt
 * the strip simply grows; that is correct, and preferable to tearing away live
 * work to satisfy a number.
 *
 * KNOWN COST — `unread` is deliberately NOT an exemption. `lastActiveAt` moves
 * only on focus, never on turn activity, so a background chat that just finished
 * carries an old LRU key and is a prime retire candidate: it can leave the strip
 * before the user ever sees its mark, and `unread` is runtime-only so reopening
 * it from the history does not bring the mark back. The alternative is worse —
 * twenty background chats finishing would exempt all twenty and make the cap
 * inert, which is the failure this file exists to prevent. The counter is that
 * the chat itself is untouched and one click from the history. Recorded here so
 * the trade-off is a decision on the record, not a bug rediscovered later.

 * so the count and the future "Ritirate di recente" group are one filter, not

 *
 * Four conditions, each load-bearing:
 * - `retiredAt` set — it was a tab and left. Every exit stamps it: the cap, both
 *   archive gestures, and the manual x (see `closeTab`). "Left the strip" has to
 *   mean one thing however you left, or the number is a subset of itself.
 * - not archived — archiving is a different exit with a different destination
 *   (the separate archive store, surfaced by the board's "Show archived").
 * - has messages — see `messages` above.
 * - not an open tab — reopening un-retires (`switchTo` clears `retiredAt`), but
 *   this also covers the window before that: a tab on screen is not "hidden".
 *
 * THE WINDOW IS CLOSED. This used to run without one — a known cost, not an
 * oversight, because the count had to equal what its destination showed, and
 * that destination was the whole history. The debt was explicit: `retiredAt`
 * never expires, so an unwindowed filter only grows, and after a few weeks it
 * reports the size of the history rather than what the strip is hiding. It is
 * closed here, together with the "Ritirate di recente" group that reads this
 * same function — the docstring that used to sit here demanded exactly that:
 * whoever added the group had to add the window in the same commit, so the
 * count and the set it opens could never point at different definitions of
 * "recently retired". The default window is short (see `DEFAULT_RETIRED_WINDOW_MS`
 * below) precisely so "recently retired" still reads as recent; a chat that
 * ages out is still on disk and still in the full history, one search away —
 * the window only stops it from being counted, and shown, as if it just
