 * instead gates an outbound message, where the two errors are not symmetric: a
 * wrong "not resumable" costs one duplicated recap (wasteful, harmless), while a
 * wrong "resumable" is the silent failure itself — the model receives no history
 * and starts blind while the transcript sits visible on screen. So this side
 * leans toward acting, but only on evidence: `absent` is the single input that
 * returns false. Every unknown keeps the pre-existing behavior of trusting the id,
 * because a `failed` lookup treated as absence would prepend a recap to every turn
 * of every conversation, forever.
 *
 * `probe` is a thunk so the guards below can short-circuit before any I/O
 * happens: a Codex conversation or an empty base must not cost a stat, and the
 * ORDER of the guards lives here, tested, rather than being duplicated by the
 * caller deciding when to look.
